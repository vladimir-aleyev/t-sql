  $Header: /WWW/sqlutil/beta_lockinfo.sp 22    17-04-08 19:02 Sommar $

  This SP lists locking information for all active processes, that is
  processes that have a running request, is holding locks or have an
  open transaction. Information about all locked objects are included,
  as well the last command sent from the client and the currently
  running statement. The procedure also displays the blocking chain
  for blocked processes.

  Note that locks and processes are read indepently from the DMVs, and
  may not be wholly in sync. Likewise, object names are retrieved later.

  This version of the procedure is for SQL 2016 and later. There are
  separate versions for SQL 2005, SQL 2008 and SQL 2012/14.

  Parameters:
  @allprocesses - If 0, only include "interesting" processes, i.e.
                  processes running something or holding locks. 1 - also
                  include "half-interesting" processes. 2- include all
                  processes.
  @textmode     - If 0, output is sent as-is, intended for grid mode.
                  If 1, output columns are trimmed the width derived from
                  data, and a blank line is inserted between spids.
  @procdata     - A - show process-common data on all rows. F - show
                  process-common data only on the first rows. Defaults
                  to A in text mode and F in grid mode.
  @archivemode  - When non-NULL, instead of outputting data, save to the table
                  guest.beta_lockinfo. Delete data from the table that is
                  older than @archivemode minutes. When 0, only create the
                  table.
  @debug        - If 1, prints progress messages with timings.

 * *****************  Version 22  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 17-04-08   Time: 19:02
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * Use the new  DMV sys_dm_exec_query_statistics_xml to see if we can get
 * query plans with actual values that way. Added some more benign wait
 * types to the list of types that are filtered out.
 *
 * *****************  Version 21  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 16-05-29   Time: 21:10
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * 1) The main version is now for SQL 2016 only.
 * 2) Fixed potential overflow problem with trn_since.
 * 3) Get inputbuffers with new DMV sys.dm_exec_input_buffer.
 * 4) New output column top5waits, using the DMV
 * sys.dm_exec_session_stats.
 * 5) Removed the dynamic check for SQL version for the fallback for
 * tables created in transactions, since it now applies in all cases.
 * 6) Use try_convert to get query plans and use the fallback only for
 * entries where it failed.
 * 7) Slight performance improvement when getting query text and plans.
 *
 * *****************  Version 20  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 16-04-24   Time: 23:41
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * Consolidate constraints of the same type for the same temp table name
 * into a single row to reduce ouput when the temp table is created over
 * and over again in the same transaction. For SQL 2014: when hobt_id
 * cannot be translated, examine whether it may relate to a lock in
 * sys.partitions.
 *
 * *****************  Version 19  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 15-02-01   Time: 20:47
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * 1) Fix a potential overflow with last_since and trn_since.
 * 2) Added a workaround for the fact that data abou uncomitted heaps
 * cannot be accessed from sys.partitions in SQL 2014.
 * 3) Remove trailing NUL character from DBCC INPUTBUFFER.
 * 4) Incorrectly reset SET LOCK_TIMEOUT to 0, it should be -1.
 *
 * *****************  Version 18  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 14-08-12   Time: 22:56
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * Had forgotten to consider negative values for last_since and trn_since
 * in the new format.
 *
 * *****************  Version 17  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 14-08-12   Time: 22:23
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * 1) Bugfix: beta_lockfinfo died with an overflow error is the instance
 * had been up >= 115 days.
 * 2) Changed format of last_since and trn_since to be days +
 * hh:mm:ss.fff.
 *
 * *****************  Version 16  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 14-01-29   Time: 22:39
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * The parameter @allprocesses now take three values 0, 1, 2. 2 shows all
 * processes, while 1 includes "half-interesting" processes. The processes
 * that now are considered "half-interesting" were previously considered
 * "interesting" and were always displayed, but they added to much noise
 * to the output. See further the section Interesting and Half-interesting
 * Processes.
 *
 * Introducing archive mode, controlled by the new parameter @archivemode.
 * In archive mode, beta_lockinfo does not produce any output, but writes
 * the data to a table. I also provide BAT files so that you easily can
 * ask someone at a remote site to run beta_lockinfo for you.
 *
 * There are no three versions of beta_lockinfo: one for SQL 2005, one for
 * SQL 2008 and one for SQL 2012 and later.
 *
 * New column in the output: memgrant, that shows the memory grant for the
 * current query for a process.
 *
 * The column rscsubtype has been augmented to also display locking
 * partitions on servers with 16 or more schedulers.
 *
 * Bugfix: a lock timeout on more than 32 767 ms would cause arithmetic
 * overflow in beta_lockinfo.
 *
 * beta_lockinfo no longer shows a blank value for last_since if the
 * process has been logged in for more than 20 days.
 *
 * Text mode was prone to yield an error about string truncation when
 * there was blocking between exec contexts.
 *
 * On SQL 2012, the statement text was stripped out from the query plans.
 * (Because beta_lockinfo corrected for a bug which exists in SQL 2008 and
 * SQL 2005, but is corrected in SQL 2012.)
 *
 * Changed the order in which beta_lockinfo retrieves information, so that
 * locks are now retrieved after the processes. This will not reduced the
 * amount of inconsistencies you will see on a busy system, but they will
 * be somewhat different in nature. :-)
 *
 * *****************  Version 15  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 12-11-18   Time: 19:14
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * Added three new columns ansiopts (to display deviate settings of
 * ANSI-relatedl SET options), trnopts (to display deviating
 * transaction-related SET options and progress (shows how work that has
 * been performed for some types of statements).
 *
 * beta_lockinfo now displays waiting tasks that are not bound to a
 * session it they have an "interesting" wait type, that is, wait types
 * commonly used by system process are ignored. Such tasks have session id
 * < -1000 in the display. The most common such wait type is THREADPOOL
 * which means that you have run out of worker threads.
 *
 *
 * *****************  Version 14  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 11-01-28   Time: 22:47
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * Temp tables are now displayed as #name only. No tempdb prefix, and
 * without the system-generated suffix to make the name unique in the
 * system catalog. Furthermore, if a process has created several temp
 * tables with the same name, the rows for these tables are aggregated to
 * one row per lock type, and a number in parentheses is added to indicate
 * the number of temp tables with that name. (The typical situations when
 * this happens is when a procedure is called several times in the same
 * transaction.) The change does not affect global temp tables.
 *
 * Table variables and other entries in the tempdb system catalog that
 * consists of a # and eight hex digits are now displayed as #(tblvar or
 * dropped temp table). As with temp tables, they are aggrgated into a
 * single row per lockwith a number added if there are several of them.
 *
 * *****************  Version 13  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 10-11-21   Time: 23:17
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * 1) Added column to show tempdb usage.
 * 2) Process is "interesting" if it allocates more than 1000 pages in
 * tempdb.
 * 3) Bugfix: Had broken procedure name translation, so current_sp was
 * always blank.
 * 4) Bugfix: procedure name and current statement was missing from text
 * mode.
 * 5) Added permission check, so procedure fails if run without VIEW
 * SERVER STATE.
 * 6) Added LOCK_TIMEOUT and error handling for object-name translation,
 * as you are blocked on SQL 2005 and SQL 2008 on system tables, if you
 * are not sysadmin. In this case, you get the error message instead of
 * the object name.
 *
 * *****************  Version 12  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 09-06-25   Time: 23:22
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * Added checks of the SQL version and the compatibility level. Added
 * columns to give information about current transactions. Fixed textmode
 * that was broken.
 *
 * *****************  Version 11  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 09-01-31   Time: 20:01
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * 1) The procedure body now reads ALTER PROCEDURE, and the script creates
 * a dummy procedure if beta_lockinfo does not exist.
 * 2) Retrieving query texts separately, to handle the case that a process
 * creates a procedure within a transaction and then executes it without
 * committing the transaction. In this case beta_lockinfo gets blocked,
 * and we fall back to get texts spid by spid.
 *
 * *****************  Version 10  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 09-01-10   Time: 22:18
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * Fixed bug that caused NULL violation when there was a lock on a dropped
 * allocatoin unit.
 *
 * *****************  Version 9  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 08-11-04   Time: 21:51
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * Failed to consider that a lead blocker may be waiting too, if not for
 * another spid.
 *
 * *****************  Version 8  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 08-11-03   Time: 23:30
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * 1) Incorrectly showed NULL in blkby when process was not blocked.
 * 2) When modifying the XML document for the plan, we need to consider
 * that our statement information may be NULL, or else .modify blows up.
 *
 * *****************  Version 7  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 08-11-02   Time: 20:55
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * Reworked the block-chain handling,so that deadlocks are detected and
 * marked with DD in the block_chain column. We also find processes that
 * are blocked by the deadlocked processes. We now also mark processes
 * that waiting for a lock, but are not in the block_chain (because they
 * started waiting after we read dm_os_waiting_tasks.)
 *
 * *****************  Version 6  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 08-11-01   Time: 22:13
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * 1) Work around bug in dm_exec_text_query_plan that causes bloat in the
 * return XML plan.
 * 2) Show database name for application locks.
 * 3) Show object_id directly when we cannot translate it.
 * 4) Return the statement text in full on the first row for a process
 * only.
 * 5) For some resource types, for instance METADATA there were two
 * identical lines displayed, because we incorrectly groupe on
 * rsc_description for other resource types than application locks.
 *
 * *****************  Version 5  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 08-08-16   Time: 23:22
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * CRLF in text mode was replaced with the empty string, not spaces.
 *
 * *****************  Version 4  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 08-08-16   Time: 23:13
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * 1) Run with a short lock-timeout when retrieving query plans. According
 * to SQL Server MVP Adam Machanic, this can occur. I'm therefore now
 * including the error message if the query plan cannot be retrieved.
 * 2) Error handling for DBCC INPUTBUFFER, as on SQL 2008 a missing spid
 * raises an error.
 *
 * *****************  Version 3  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 07-12-09   Time: 23:15
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * 1] Implemented a workaround to avoid the problem with duplicates keys
 * that occur when the two tasks got the same execution context id.
 * 2) Also worked around a case where dm_os_waiting_tasks can include
 * duplicate rows.
 * 3) If a thread is only blocking other threads or requests in the same
 * thread, put the value in block_level in parentheses.
 * 4) Added an indicator in the blkby column on how many other tasks
 * that may be blocking.
 * 5) The spid string now uses slashes as delimiter. This is because that
 * use -1 indicate that a task was that was blocking had exited when
 * we merge the block chain with the processes.
 * 6) I'm now reading sys.dm_exec_sessions and related views more
 * directly after reading sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks to increase the odds
 * for a consistent view.
 *
 * *****************  Version 2  *****************
 * User: Sommar       Date: 07-11-18   Time: 20:49
 * Updated in $/WWW/sqlutil
 * 1) Adding error handling around INSERTs that are known to bomb on
 *    PK violation, and produce a debug output, so we can find out what is
 * going on.
 * 2) Added fallback for the possible case that the query plan is not
 *   convertible to XML. Kudos to SQL Server MVP Razvan Socol for
 *   giving me a test case.
